Solution title: Concept solution for the "Naše blago" open portal

Open data gathered by public institutions in the management of food production increases the value of the food production sector by ensuring the producers’ efficacy and savings of energy and resources. Furthermore, agriculture open data use has the potential for the conservation of animal genomic resources in indigenous animal breeds (local breeds). They are usually reared in a restricted geographic area and struggle with the loss of market space in comparison to commercial animal breeds making the conservation inefficient and/or costly.
The data from the livestock sector in Croatia is predominately aggregated, incomplete, and is opened by different institutions/agencies mostly in non-open file formats. Additionally, farm location data and livestock register are not open data sets in Croatia, possibly due to the lack of GDPR understanding. 
We envisioned a conceptual solution; a centralized portal of publicly available agriculture sector data on indigenous farm animals and products with interactive map visualization and dashboard. Firstly, our portal would enable faster access to consolidated existing data in a shorter time for farmers, markets, and other users. Secondly, it would provide the visual locations of secondary and tertiary services - restaurants, eco-tourism, manufacturing, retail stores, etc. Likewise, data filtering would provide the review of statistical data at the level of county, municipality, city, growers, secondary processors (OPG), etc. via dashboards. 
Our solution is unique in the Croatian agricultural open data ecosystem, with great potential to increase the value of the agriculture economy and prosperity of rural areas in the Republic of Croatia by providing the geolocation (business address) and market data (prices) in a non-aggregated and machine-readable format.
